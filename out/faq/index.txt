3:T5d6,The new campus of IIIT Dharwad is located in a 60-acre plot between the two cities of Hubballi and Dharwad. It is close to both cities and also the Hubballi Airport (UBX) yet away from all the traffic, noise and pollution. The location is indeed pristine, right where the hills start on the way to Western Ghats. It is also the catchment area of river Shalmala that flows down to join Arabian Sea near Karwar. Dharwad is a well-known center for higher learning including music and arts. Hubballi-Dharwad are having a significant concentration of Higher Educational institutions and universities of repute including Indian Institute of Technology-Dharwad (IIT Dharwad), Karnataka University Dharwad, University of Agricultural Sciences Dharwad, Karnataka State Law University, KLE Technological University, Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences and Hospital, SDM College of Medical Sciences and Hospital, SDM Dental Sciences and Hospital, and SDM College of Engineering and Technology. Hubballi-Dharwad are twin cities, now being developed as smart cities in the state of Karnataka and together form the 2nd largest urban city next to Bangalore. The two cities are connected by a modern BRTS - Bus Rapid Transit System - that provides convenient access to our campus. The cities are located 410 kms from Bangalore city with excellent connectivity by air, rail and road to Bangalore, thereby enabling IIIT Dharwad to reap rich dividends from the strengths of Bangalore as the nation’s IT hub.0:["D1Bqy4kOpzgTYEif_XStw",[[["",{"children":["faq",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["faq",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},[["$L1",["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","br",null,{}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-dwd-primary text-3xl text-bold text-center  font-roboto","children":"Frequently Asked Questions"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"w-4/5 center mx-auto my-10","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"ques":"Where is IIIT Dharwad located?","ans":"$3"}],["$","$L2",null,{"ques":"How to reach IIIT Dharwad?","ans":["$","div",null,{"children":["You can come to Sattur stop on the Hubballi-Dharwad Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) from where a shuttle service is arranged to the IIIT Dharwad campus.
